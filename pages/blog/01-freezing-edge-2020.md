Freezing Edge is a new conference concept from the team behind [React Finland](https://react-finland.fi) and [GraphQL Finland](https://graphql-finland.fi). The aforementioned conferences are what I might call traditional community-oriented tech conferences.

The idea has always been to connect the Finnish tech community with the international one by bringing speakers from abroad. Incidentally our conferences also attract attendees from abroad so they are truly international ones.

## Focus on Future Tech

Given we've experience about running tech-focused conferences, we decided to try something different. Instead of focusing on a specific tech, Freezing Edge has focus on the technology of the future. Ideally we should be able to show you what development is like within the next five to ten years.

Because of this, we'll have a broad range of topics from programming languages to virtual reality, audio, and graphics. In this one day conference, we'll have around eight speakers discussing the topics.

## Interactive Live Coding

To make it interesting, we'll avoid the tried and true presentation format. Freezing Edge is held in a live coding format. You should expect 30-45 minute sessions where the speaker will perform within the agreed theme.

To make the experience more interesting for everyone, we'll do our best to find ways to make the sessions interactive in such way that the audience input can shape the content.

The format is a challenge for our speakers as you cannot prepare as well as for a regular talk. It will take nerves of steel to perform at Freezing Edge and I believe we've found a great cast to make it worthwhile.

## Conclusion

We hope you'll come join us in the first edition of Freezing Edge. The pricing begins from 199 eur and you can [buy tickets now](https://fienta.com/freezing-edge-2020?dc887244cff3ca32249a722f217ad0d6).
